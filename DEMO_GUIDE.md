## üöÄ **Demo Script**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**

> "Good [morning/afternoon] judges! I'm excited to present the Coral Protocol Voice-Payment Agent System - a revolutionary cross-border payment platform that transforms voice commands into instant, secure payments using multi-agent orchestration.
>
> **The Problem**: Traditional cross-border payments take 3-5 days and cost 3.5% in fees. Users need to navigate complex forms and wait for manual processing.
>
> **Our Solution**: Speak your payment intent, and our AI agents handle everything in 0.3 seconds with 99.5% fraud detection accuracy.
>
> Let me show you how it works..."

### **Live Demo (3-4 minutes)**
